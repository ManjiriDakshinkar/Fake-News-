#  Detecting Misinformation in Gold Price News: A Machine Learning Approach ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

This repository contains the full implementation of a machine learning pipeline to detect fake news articles related to gold price and investments in the Indian financial media landscape.

##  Project Overview

Gold plays a vital economic and cultural role in India, making it highly vulnerable to misinformation, especially across digital platforms. This project uses NLP and machine learning to:
- Classify gold-related news as **True** or **Fake**
- Identify patterns in fake news using **EDA** and **n-gram analysis**
- Evaluate the performance of multiple ML models for deployment

##  Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.10**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation
- **NLTK**, **spaCy** â€“ Natural Language Processing
- **TfidfVectorizer**, **CountVectorizer** â€“ Text vectorization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Model training & evaluation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **WordCloud** â€“ Visualization
- **BeautifulSoup**, **requests** â€“ Web scraping
